# SimpleUnityROSSimulation
Creating a simple Unity project to interface with ROS (and possibly ROS2). This is currently a work in progress as I figure out what I want to do. More details will be added later on.

## Development Environment
* OS: Ubuntu 20.04
* Unity Version: Unity 2020.3.10f1

## External Resources
* Unity [URDF-Importer](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/URDF-Importer) - used to import the robots into Unity

* [ros-industrial/universal_robot](https://github.com/ros-industrial/universal_robot) repository - all URDFs and associated meshes were obtained from here
